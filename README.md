# Time_State
A 3D Godot Game that is open world and is a Work In Progress

Disclaimer: All Assets are made by Me, and no outsourcing was done in the making of this project.

This Game is Early in Development and may be prone to bugs graphically or within the project code depending on how it is implemented or compiled after the finished product is Compiled into EXE, DMG, or TPZ although the project can be updated and fixed by anyone willing to help by pushing the pull request button after modifying or fixing the issue and I will review the code and either approve or deny the change.

Secondary Disclaimer: This game can also be released with another person's vision as long as it does not contain all of my work up to the point of the current project stage so removal of original assets' except for the map will need to be required, and if caught releasing my work will be met with legal action, THANK YOU!
